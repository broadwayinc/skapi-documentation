# API Bridge

Skapi's API Bridge allows your service to connect external API's.

API Bridge provides [`secureRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#securerequest) and [`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#clientsecretrequest) methods to make secure requests to your custom API's.

[`secureRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#securerequest) is used to make a secure request to your custom API's.
[`clientSecretRequest()`](/api-reference/api-bridge/README.md#clientsecretrequest) is used to make a request to your 3rd party API with a client secret key.

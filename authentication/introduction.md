# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.

It is a fundamental part of any application, as it allows users to control access to your application and its resources.

Authenticated users can have access to post data to your database, and also can have access to your custom APIs.

Skapi provides a full featured authentication system out of the box without the need for any additional configuration.

In this section, you will learn how to let users create an account, login, and logout from your service, or recover their account if they have forgotten their password.

# Database

Skapi provides fast, simple, secure, yet flexible way to store, retrieve data from your database.

You can start storing any data from small json data to large binary files up to 5tb per file while Skapi handles the security, indexing, and file storage for you.

Files will be served through the CDN, and will have restricted access based on the access group the uploader has set.

Mind you, Skapi database has completely different approach to database management compared to traditional databases.

We designed the database to be User-Centric, meaning that the end-users(frontend) are the one configuring the database schema and security for you.

By this approach, the database does not require any complex setup, or schema definition that cost time and money just to get things started.

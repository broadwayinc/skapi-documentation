## Downloading the Source Code

Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/broadwayinc/skapi-tutorial.git)

Or clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/broadwayinc/skapi-tutorial.git
```

## Pre Requisites

Create an account on [Skapi](https://skapi.com) and create a new service.

The **service_id** and the **owner_id** values are set in `service.js` file.

Currently, the values are set to:
  - Service ID: **"ap220wfRHl9Cw2QqeFEc"**
  - Owner ID: **"f8e16604-69e4-451c-9d90-4410f801c006"**

Replace the values with your own service ID and owner ID.

You can retrieve your own service ID and owner ID from your Skapi service dashboard.

## Opening the Project

In the project directory, you will find the following files:

```
.
├─ authentication
│  ├─ change_password.html
│  ├─ create-account.html
│  ├─ email-verification.html
│  ├─ forgot-password.html

This project does not require any build tools. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser, and it will just work.

If you are on remote server, run the following command to host the project:

```bash
npm run start 3000
```
*The number 3000 is the port number. You can change it to any port number you want.*

You will be able to access the project at `http://[your remote server url]:3000`.

# Hosting your website

Skapi provides a straight forward hosting service for your website.
You can host your website with Skapi by simply uploading your website files in your `File Hosting` page.

## Registering Your Subdomain

Before you upload your website files, you must register a subdomain for your website.
Go to `File Hosting` page. If the service does not have a subdomain, it will ask you to make one.

## Uploading Your Website Files

Once you have registered your subdomain, you can upload your website files by drag and dropping your files in the file section which is at the bottom section of your `File Hosting` page.

When the files are uploaded, all the files will be hosted in your subdomain.
For example, if you registered `mywebsite` as your subdomain, and have uploaded a file named `yourfile.ext`, the file will be hosted publicly in `https://mywebsite.skapi.com/yourfile.ext`.

:::info
- When you overwrite a file with the same name, the file will be replaced with the new file.
- When overwriting or deleting a file, please allow couple of minutes for CDN to update it's cache.

Since the files are hosted publicly, **DO NOT** upload any sensitive files in your hosting page.

## index.html

If you have an `index.html` file in your root level, it will be hosted in your subdomain's root directory.

# AI-Driven Development

Skapi works well with AI-driven coding assistants.

You need to download the system prompt file below so your assistant understands how to integrate the Skapi API into your project.

## For Chat Based Platforms (e.g., Lovable, Bolt, ChatGPT)

### 1. Download the following file

<a href="https://docs.skapi.com/SKAPI.md" download="SKAPI.md">⬇️ SKAPI.md (Click to Download)</a>

### 2. Attach the file and use this prompt:

```
Use the file "SKAPI.md" as a system prompt. 
My Skapi service ID is: "xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx".
Build me a ...
```

## For AI Code Generators (e.g., Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI)

### 1. Download the following file

<a href="https://docs.skapi.com/SKAPI.md" download="SKAPI.md">⬇️ SKAPI.md (Click to Download)</a>


### 2. Rename the file

Rename the downloaded `SKAPI.md` file to a filename your coding assistant recognizes, and add the file to your project folder.

(e.g., `AGENT.md` for OpenAI Codex, `CLAUDE.md` for Anthropic Claude, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI) 

### 3. Start Writing Prompts

```
My Skapi service ID is: "xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx".
Build me a ...
```


Replace `xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual service ID.

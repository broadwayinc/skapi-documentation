# AI-Driven Development

Skapi works seamlessly with AI-driven development environments such as OpenAI Codex and Anthropic Claude Code.

To enable AI-driven development, download the system prompt file below so your AI model can understand how to integrate the Skapi API into your project.

**Download the file below to your project folder:**

<a href="https://docs.skapi.com/SYS.md" download="SYS.md">⬇️ SYS.md</a> -
A default system prompt for AI coding assistants, plus Skapi API docs and data types in a single Markdown file.

:::danger Important
Rename the `SYS.md` file to an appropriate filename that your coding assistant recognizes.

(e.g., `AGENT.md` for OpenAI Codex, `CLAUDE.md` for Anthropic Claude)

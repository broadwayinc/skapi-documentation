## Public Attributes

Certain user profile attributes can be configured as public or private.
When the profile is public, the user's profile information can be searched by other users.
When the profile is private, the user's profile information cannot be searched by other users.

The following attributes can be set to public or private:

- `email`
- `phone_number`
- `address`
- `gender`
- `birthdate`

By default, these attributes are set to private.

Here is an example of setting the user's email to public:

:::code-group

```html [Form]
<form onsubmit="skapi.updateProfile(event).then(user=>console.log(user))">
    <input type="checkbox" name="email_public" value="true"> Make email public
    <br>
    <input type="submit" value="Update Profile">
</form>
```

``` js [JS]
let params = {
    email_public: true
}

skapi.updateProfile(params)
  .then(user => {
    console.log({user}); // User's email is now public.
  });
```
